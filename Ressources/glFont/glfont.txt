C++ port of glFont API

Introduction
============
Thanks for downloading glFont!

glFont is a Win32 program that creates a texture containing a range of
characters in a specified font, and automatically generates texture coordinates
for use in OpenGL applications that need to display text.  The font type is not
limited to monospaced fonts; each character is displayed with correct spacing
and size.

Text is rendered by texture mapping specific characters onto OpenGL quads.  It
is quite possible and easy to modify the color, size, position of the text
quads using standard OpenGL functions.  It is also quite possible to load as
many different fonts as you wish, and use them whenever you please.


Main changes in C++ port
===================
- Arranged code into three classes, GLFontBase, GLFont and PixelPerfectGLFont.
  Users should only use GLFont and PixelPerfectGLFont.
- Added built-in support for pixel-perfect font rendering.
- Changed error handling to use expections instead of return codes.

Sample C++ Code
===============

(window must be initialized before this):

	//Initialize OpenGL
	glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
	glEnable(GL_BLEND);
	glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);

	//Initialize the viewport
	glViewport(0, 0, 640, 480);

	//Initialize OpenGL projection matrix
	glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
	glLoadIdentity();
	glOrtho(0.0f, 640.0f, 480.0f, 0.0f, -2.0f, 2.0f);

	//Clear back buffer
	glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

	//Create font
	GLuint textureName;
	glGenTextures(1, &textureName);
	PixelPerfectGLFont font;
	try {
		font.Create("fonts/quad20.glf", textureName);
	}
	catch(GLFontError::InvalidFile) {
		cerr << "Cannot load font\n";
		abort();
	}

	//Draw some stuff
	glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
	glLoadIdentity( );
	glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
	glColor3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

	try {
		font.Begin();
		font.TextOut("hello world", 50, 50, 0);;
	}
	catch(GLFontError::InvalidFont) {
		cerr << "Trying to draw with an uninitialized font\n";
		abort();
	}
	glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
	glLoadIdentity();

Files You Should Have Received
==============================
The following files should be contained in the ZIP you downloaded.  If not,
 please contact me, and let me know where you downloaded it from.

1.  glFont.exe -- the glFont builder
2.  glFont.h -- the header for the glFont API
3.  glFont.c -- the source for the glFont API
4.  glFont.txt -- the file you are now reading

Distribution
============
You may distribute glFont as long as it is the original, unmodified ZIP,
 available from my web site, containing the files above.

The newest version of glFont will always be available at the following URL:
http://students.cs.byu.edu/~bfish/glfont.php

Terms of Use
============
You may use the source to the glFont API in any program you wish, commercial and
non-commercial, as long as credit is given to myself (in the accompanying
program documentation, or in the program itself), including my e-mail address
and a link to my web page.  You may modify the source to fit your specific
needs if wish, but the same terms apply--you must provide original credit to
myself.

The source to the glFont builder is available for purchase; contact me if you
are interested.

Thanks for using glFont!
